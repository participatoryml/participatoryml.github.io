## Overview

The designers of a machine learning (ML) system typically have far more power
over the system than the individuals who are ultimately impacted by the system
and its decisions. Recommender platforms shape the users' preferences; the
individuals classified by a model often do not have means to contest a decision;
and the data required by supervised ML systems necessitates that the privacy and
labour of many yield to the design choices of a few.

The fields of algorithmic fairness and human-centered ML often focus on
centralized solutions, lending increasing power to system designers and
operators, and less to users and affected populations. In response to the
growing social-science critique of the power imbalance present in the research,
design, and deployment of ML systems, we wish to consider a new set of technical
formulations for the ML community on the subject of more democratic,
cooperative, and participatory ML systems.

Our workshop aims to explore methods that, by design, enable and encourage the
perspectives of those impacted by an ML system to shape the system and its
decisions. By involving affected populations in shaping the goals of the overall
system, we hope to move beyond just tools for enabling human participation and
progress towards a redesign of power dynamics in ML systems.

### Topics

We invite work that makes progress on the workshop themes, including but not
limited to:

-   **Recourse and reachability**: Creating systems that ensure the user
    has the potential to adapt their predictions or recommendations
    ([Ustun, Spangher, and Liu 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06514);
    [Dean, Rich, and Recht 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10068)).

    ML systems. Limitations of current methods in fully capturing a
    user’s ‘preferences’

    involvement in ML:** Qualitative and quantitative methods and
    frameworks aimed at giving a voice to communities affected by ML
    systems. Tools for collective training processes and collective

    incorporate deferral to humans, or at least a non-classification
    outcome.

## Schedule

The central part of our workshop is the [livestream on the ICML virtual
site](https://icml.cc/virtual/2020/workshop/5720). The livestream will broadcast invited talks and
panels, as well as the latest announcements and possible schedule changes. The interactive
discussions with other participants---poster and breakout sessions---will happen on our [Discord
server](https://discord.gg/KSAwXKs).

{% include schedule.html data=site.data.schedule_2020 %}

## Poster Sessions

Each contributed paper has its own audio/video channel on our Discord server.
During the "poster" session, participants can discuss the paper with its authors in the respective channel.
_Before joining a channel as a participant, please make sure to familiarize yourself with the paper
and watch the paper's short introduction video._

### Poster Session 1 (<span class="timespan">2:45 PM - 3:30 PM UTC</span>)

audio/video channels; we will add channels during the day if topics come up. In addition to this, as an
experiment, we will have thematic discussion sessions guided by facilitators:

## Call for Papers

The workshop will include contributed papers. All accepted papers will be
allocated either a virtual poster presentation, or a virtual talk slot. We will
not publish proceedings, but will optionally link the papers and talk recordings
on the workshop website.

We invite submissions in two tracks:

* **Research Track.** Full papers, works-in-progress, position papers, and case studies. We expect
  that these submissions introduce novel ideas or results.

  The papers should have up to 4 pages (excluding references, acknowledgements, or appendices), and
  be formatted using the [ICML submission
  template](https://media.icml.cc/Conferences/ICML2020/Styles/icml2020_style.zip). Papers should be
  anonymized.

* **Encore Track.** Papers that have already been accepted at other venues.

  There are no format requirements for this track. The papers should be accepted
  at another recognized archival conference or journal, and be submitted by one
  of the paper's authors.

Submissions are currently closed.

For any questions, please send us an email to `participatory-ml-organizers` at `lists.mayfirst.org`
