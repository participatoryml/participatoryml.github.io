title: Participatory Approaches to Machine Learning
subtitle: ICML 2020 Workshop (July 17 or 18)
---

## Overview

The designers of a machine learning (ML) system typically have far more
power over the system than the individuals who are ultimately impacted
by the system and its decisions. Recommender platforms shape the users’
preferences; the individuals classified by a model often do not have
means to contest a decision; and the data required by ML systems
necessitates that the privacy of many yield to the design choices of a
few.

Many sub-fields of ML are concerned with incorporating user feedback and
preferences, including human-in-the-loop learning, mechanism design, and
recommender systems. However, these sub-fields usually involve humans
with the goal of better optimizing a centrally imposed objective. In
response, our workshop aims to explore methods that, by design, enable
and encourage the perspectives of those impacted by an ML system to
shape the system and its decisions. We thus invite ML researchers to
consider approaches for designing more *democratic, cooperative, and
participatory ML systems.*

The fields of algorithmic fairness and human-centered ML often focus on
*centralized* solutions, lending increasing power to system designers and
deployers, and less to users and affected populations. In response to the
growing social science critique of the power imbalance present in the research,
design, and deployment of ML systems, we wish to consider *a new set of
technical formulations for the ML community* on the subject of more democratic,
cooperative, and participatory ML systems.

Whereas several past workshops have been broadly concerned with societal
issues of AI deployment, this workshop has a clearer technical goal: to
address the power differentials embedded in ML systems. By involving
affected populations in shaping the goals of the overall system, we hope
to move beyond just tools for enabling human participation to a redesign
of power dynamics.

### Topics

We invite work that makes progress on the workshop themes, including but not
limited to:

-   **Recourse and reachability**: Creating systems that ensure the user
    has the potential to adapt their predictions or recommendations
    ([Ustun, Spangher, and Liu 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06514);
    [Dean, Rich, and Recht 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10068)).

-   **Richer interactive ML:** Incorporating richer user feedback into
    ML systems. Limitations of current methods in fully capturing a
    user’s ‘preferences’
    ([Schnabel, Bennett, and Joachims 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07578);
    [Yang et al. 2019](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2327/IUI19WS-ExSS2019-9.pdf))

-   **Mechanism design or computational social choice and learning**:
    designs that incorporate preference elicitation in allocative ML
    systems, such as adaptive experimentation or learning-based
    algorithmic governance
    ([Narita 2019](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3094905);
    [M. K. Lee et al. 2019](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akahng/papers/webuildai.pdf));
    [Kahng et al. 2019](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/kahng19a.html))

-   **Collective and participatory design applied to community
    involvement in ML:** Qualitative and quantitative methods and
    frameworks aimed at giving a voice to communities affected by ML
    systems. Tools for collective training processes and collective
    design of ML systems
    ([Katell et al. 2020](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pkrafft/papers/critplat-toolkit-lessons.pdf);

    [Patton et al. 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3375627.3375841)).

-   **Deferral and/or abstention**: Classification frameworks which
    incorporate deferral to humans, or at least a non-classification
    outcome.
    ([Madras, Pitassi, and Zemel 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06664);
    [El-Yaniv and Wiener 2010](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/el-yaniv10a/el-yaniv10a.pdf)).

-   **Documentation & audit methods:** Work which is intended to inform
    and engage users in model design, development or deployment
    processes and its limitations
    ([Mitchell et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993);
    [Ali & Sapieżyński et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02095)).

-   **Contestation:** Technological methods and tools for
    analyzing/protesting/contesting the outcomes of ML systems in the
    absence of centralized cooperation 
    ([Kulynych & Overdorf et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02711);
    [Ali & Sapieżyński et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02095)).

-   **Tools that support community and worker organization**
    ([Matias and Mou 2018](https://natematias.com/media/Community_Led_Experiments-CHI_2018.pdf);
    [Irani and Silberman 2013](http://crowdsourcing-class.org/readings/downloads/ethics/turkopticon.pdf);

## Fully Virtual Format

Because of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic, the workshop will take place virtually.
The exact format will be based on the [ICML conference guidelines](https://icml.cc).

## Call for Papers

The workshop will include contributed papers. All accepted papers will be
allocated either a virtual poster presentation, or a virtual talk slot. We will
not publish proceedings, but will optionally link the papers and talk recordings
on this page.

We invite submissions in two tracks:

* **Research Track.** Full papers, works-in-progress, and position papers. We
  expect that these submissions introduce novel ideas or results.

  The papers should have up to 4 pages (excluding references, acknowledgements,
  or appendices), and be formatted using the ICML submission template. Papers
  should be anonymized.

* **Encore Track.** Papers that have already been accepted at other venues.

  There are no format requirements for this track. The papers should be accepted
  at another recognized academic conference, and be submitted by one of the
  paper's authors.

Submission website: **TBD**
